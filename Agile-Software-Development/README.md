## Overview

The Agile Methodology (or simply Agile) is a common approach to software development and project management. It is a set of practices which promote the continuous iteration of development and testing of software throughout its development lifecycle. The term 'Agile' is also used as an umbrella term for many lightweight software development processes. To name a few, we have Scrum, eXtreme Programming (XP), Kanban, and Scrumban (a combination of both Scrum and Kanban).

###### Why Agile
The Agile Methodologies are very common within the software industry and can be considered an industry standard for project management. Familiarizing yourself with the content of this module will aid you in understanding part of the software development life cycle and will ultimately benefit you throughout your career. It's also much easier to learn Agile processes practically, however, the values and principles that the Agile Methodology describes is very useful to understand.

###### Purpose
