# Advanced Feature: Testing
This year's testing section will be split into the following sections:
 - Backend Unit Testing
 - Frontend Unit Testing
 - Behavioural Driven Testing (Automated testing)

You will only have to implement one of the above if you choose to add testing as one of your advanced features.
## Assignment Criteria
To pass this as advanced feature in your phase 2 project you must do one of the three testing.
Your test must have atleast 3 tests overall.
Doing sections of testing will (not)count towards your advance features

# About Unit Testing

Unit Testing is a form of Automated Testing, which is simply the practice of writing code that tests your application code. An individual test will pass some inputs to your code and make sure that the outputs are correct. If they aren't, the test fails. Otherwise, it passes. A Unit Test is the lowest form of test and tests an individual _unit_ of software - that is, individual methods/functions and classes.

There are quite a few other categories of software testing. The main other kind of automated test that you'll hear talked about is the integration test, which tests multiple parts of your software working together along with external dependencies such as databases (making sure your units work when you put them together). We won't be covering integration testing as it's more important for projects of bigger scope, but it's good to be aware of what it is.

## Why do we Unit Test?

Everyone, no matter how much or little they plan it, tests their code. Surely at some point in the past when you've been making a Web App or some kind of GUI, you've run it and made sure all the UI elements do what they're supposed to. Alternatively, maybe you've made a quick little command line script that lets you input values to be passed to a function, and then outputs the results. Those are both forms of testing!

The problem with testing your software manually like this is that as your application grows in complexity, it takes longer and longer to go through the steps, because it becomes more difficult to reach the desired functionality (e.g. more clicks of the UI). Automatically testing our code is much more efficient, and generally speaking the time it takes to run tests increases more linearly.

Unit Testing provides confidence that your code is working _before_ you deploy it - less bugs in production, yay! Tests can be run every time code is deployed, so if any breaking changes are made they will be detected. This means you can refactor or make additions more freely knowing that your functionality is not being compromised.

Why Unit Testing specifically? Why not just test our program as a whole and cover more code in a shorter amount of time? Well, the problem is that when you test multiple components as a black box, you have no way of telling what exact line(s) of code caused the bug.
## When to Unit Test

One of the biggest debates surrounding software testing is whether or not you should write your test _before_ or _after_ the actual code. Many people say you should write your tests for a class/module before you implement it. This is known as Test-Driven Development (TDD). Whether or not this is actually the case in practice is another story...

The main arguments for TDD are that it provides clarity and motivation for simplicity. By writing the tests for a unit before you implement it, you get to think about the requirements of your code so you get a better idea of how to write it because you understand what it should do. Additionally, you shouldn't theoretically add any unnecessary functionality because you're only writing the code so that it passes the tests - ergo, simplicity!

Sometimes requirements are liable to change and you can get a better understanding of the problem by going ahead and solving it. Hence, a lot of developers prefer to write tests after the code is written. The problem with this is that it can be hard to stay "on topic" and it's easy to write redundant code.

However, as new programmers / being new to a certain language or framework, it's quite infeasible to write our tests beforehand because we might not even understand how the code is going to work. This is precisely why we've waited until a later module of MSA phase 2 to show you how to do unit tests for an ASP.NET Core web API.

## Writing Unit Tests
Iâ€™ll be using a modified backend project from phase 1 to do some example unit testing. Anyone who did the backend for phase 1 will be familiar with most of the code but there will be extra classes and some refactor done to make the testing easier. Be aware on you own project you many need to refactor code in order to to make testing easier.

## Creating the Project

Have the StudentSIMS solution open in Visual Studio. Start by adding an NUnit project to it.

File -> New -> Project

Scroll down to NUnit Test Project (.Net Core), select it, then click "Next".

Give the project a name in the format "[project being tested].Tests, Make sure to select "Add to solution" as shown in the image below, then click "Create".
![]

### Setting up the Test Project
Start by adding a reference from the newly created test project to the API project. Right-click on the unit test project in the solution explorer:

Then go Add -> Project Reference... -> Select StudentSIMS
![]
Now we are going to add a couple of packages that will let us use a mock database (More on this in a bit). Right-click on the project solution and select "Manage NuGet Packages for solution" Add to the solution:

- Moq
- NUnit
- Nunit Test Adapter

### Now we can start testing.
Delete the default UnitTest.cs file.

There are 2 Test that I will show as an example. One for classes that have database access and the other with HTTP request from controllers. The database version has a significant more setup in the arrange to recreate the return data from the database.

### Testing code that has database access

Right-click on the test project

Delect (add -> New Item)

Create a new .cs and call it CountryIdentifiersUnitTests.cs and add the follow code

```C#
[Test]
        public void GetAllCountries_ReturnsAllRecords()
        {
            //This test is the basic layout if you want to simulate database queries using linq.
            //Arrange
            var countries = new List<CountryIdentifiers>
            {
                new CountryIdentifiers()
                {
                    CountryId = 1,
                    CountryCode = "NZ",
                    PhoneExtension = "64"
                },
                new CountryIdentifiers()
                {
                    CountryId = 2,
                    CountryCode = "AU",
                    PhoneExtension = "61"
                }
            }.AsQueryable();

            var mockSet = new Mock<DbSet<CountryIdentifiers>>();
            mockSet.As<IQueryable<CountryIdentifiers>>().Setup(m => m.Provider).Returns(countries.Provider);
            mockSet.As<IQueryable<CountryIdentifiers>>().Setup(m => m.Expression).Returns(countries.Expression);
            mockSet.As<IQueryable<CountryIdentifiers>>().Setup(m => m.ElementType).Returns(countries.ElementType);
            mockSet.As<IQueryable<CountryIdentifiers>>().Setup(m => m.GetEnumerator()).Returns(countries.GetEnumerator());

            var mockContext = new Mock<StudentContext>();
            mockContext.Setup(c => c.CountryIdentifiers).Returns(mockSet.Object);
            //Act
            var service = new CountryIdentifiersRepository(mockContext.Object);
            var results = service.GetAllCountries().ToList();

            //Assert
            Assert.AreEqual(2, results.Count());
            Assert.AreEqual("NZ", results[0].CountryCode);
            Assert.AreEqual("AU", results[1].CountryCode);

        }
```
<details><summary>Arrange Snippet</summary>

```C#
var countries = new List<CountryIdentifiers>
            {
                new CountryIdentifiers()
                {
                    CountryId = 1,
                    CountryCode = "NZ",
                    PhoneExtension = "64"
                },
                new CountryIdentifiers()
                {
                    CountryId = 2,
                    CountryCode = "AU",
                    PhoneExtension = "61"
                }
            }.AsQueryable();
```
Here we are creating some dummy data as a list then making it a queryable list so that we can use linq on it

```C#
var mockSet = new Mock<DbSet<CountryIdentifiers>>();
            mockSet.As<IQueryable<CountryIdentifiers>>().Setup(m => m.Provider).Returns(countries.Provider);
            mockSet.As<IQueryable<CountryIdentifiers>>().Setup(m => m.Expression).Returns(countries.Expression);
            mockSet.As<IQueryable<CountryIdentifiers>>().Setup(m => m.ElementType).Returns(countries.ElementType);
            mockSet.As<IQueryable<CountryIdentifiers>>().Setup(m => m.GetEnumerator()).Returns(countries.GetEnumerator());
            
```
Here we are using moq package to fake our Dbset (table in our database) and setting it up so whenever any method calls the database we return our fake data that we have set (i.e. countries). We are doing this so that we can remove the dependency of using a database. InMemory can work for this situation however due it doesn't work too well for relational databases.
```C#
            var mockContext = new Mock<StudentContext>();
            mockContext.Setup(c => c.CountryIdentifiers).Returns(mockSet.Object);
```
Now that we have set a Dbset we need to set it up  so that when the context gets called it returns the Dbset we are mocking.

```C#
            var service = new CountryIdentifiersRepository(mockContext.Object);
            var results = service.GetAllCountries().ToList();
```
Here wer are creating our an instance of our class where we pass/inject in our mocked context. This means that anytime our context gets called we return data that we have set in the Arrange snippet.
</details>

<details><summary>Assert Snippet</summary>

```C#
            Assert.AreEqual(2, results.Count());
            Assert.AreEqual("NZ", results[0].CountryCode);
            Assert.AreEqual("AU", results[1].CountryCode);
```
Here we are now checking the return results from our method that we tested. We are first checking if the it returned the correct amount. Then checking if the results are both the ones we have set. Normally you would have one assert per test but sometimes you can have multiple.

### Testing code that regular code
Right-click on the test project

Delect (add -> New Item)

Create a new .cs and call it StudentControllerTest.cs and add the follow code

```C#
        [Test]
        public void GetStudentPhoneNumberWithExtension_ReturnsPhoneNumberWithCorrectExtension()
        {
            //Arrange
            Student student = new Student { 
                studentId = 1, 
                firstName = "firstname 1", 
                lastName = "lastname 1", 
                phoneNumber ="555555555" 
                };

            var mockRepo = new Mock<ICountryIdentifierRepository>();
            mockRepo.Setup(c => c.GetStudentById(It.IsAny<int>())).Returns(student);
            mockRepo.Setup(c => c.GetCountryExtension(It.IsAny<string>())).Returns("64");

            //Act
            var controller = new StudentsController(mockRepo.Object);
            var results = controller.GetStudentPhoneNumberWithExtension(student.studentId);

            //Assert
            Assert.IsNotNull(results);
            Assert.AreEqual("64555555555", results.Value.ToString());
        }
```
<details><summary>Arrange Snippet</summary>
Here We are create oour student with some mock data. we then set it so that whenever the functions in ICountryIdentifierRepository.cs get called (GetStudentById, GetCountryExtension) we override their actual logic and return the data we expect in a the function should return. The reason this is done is because we don't care what the functions other than the one we test are doing. We assume the other functions already have unit tests so there is no need to test it in this test case.

Note: I am using a Interface version of the CountryIdentifierRepositry because it makes it easier to test. ICountryIdentifierRepositry is just basically a specification for what functions have to be implemented.

```C#
            //Arrange
            Student student = new Student { 
                studentId = 1, 
                firstName = "firstname 1", 
                lastName = "lastname 1", 
                phoneNumber ="555555555" 
                };

            var mockRepo = new Mock<ICountryIdentifierRepository>();
            mockRepo.Setup(c => c.GetStudentById(It.IsAny<int>())).Returns(student);
            mockRepo.Setup(c => c.GetCountryExtension(It.IsAny<string>())).Returns("64");
```
</details>

<details><summary>Act Snippet</summary>
Here we create the controller and pass in our mock repository into it. We also call the function we are testing and storing the result.

```C#
            var controller = new StudentsController(mockRepo.Object);
            var results = controller.GetStudentPhoneNumberWithExtension(student.studentId);
```
</details>
<details><summary>Assert Snippet</summary>
In the assert portion we check the results aren't null and that the valued return from the controller is what we expect.

```C#
            Assert.IsNotNull(results);
            Assert.AreEqual("64555555555", results.Value.ToString());
```

</details>

<details><summary>Note about Student Controller</summary>
So you may have notice that I have inject the mock repository into my controller. I have created a second contstructor explicitly for this repo. You may have to do this if you plan to unit test. I have also following the repository pattern allow me to test more easily. Repository pattern calls to seperate the Data access layer from your control logic and business logic. In this case my controller shouldn't have the context injected at all and it each http request currently in my code will have to move to a new repository (e.g. StudentRepository). Then the controller will simply take in the repository instead of the current context we have.

# About Automated Acceptance test

## Why do we Automated Acceptance test?

## When to Automated Acceptance test?

## Writing BDD Tests
Before we start you will need to install some extensions for us to run the tests. 
### Setup
In Visual Studio 2019 -> Extension -> Manage Extensions

Search and install the following:
- Nunit 3 Test Adapter
- SpecFlow for Visual Studio 2019

You will need to restart Visual Studio for the extension to install.

### Creating the project

Open Visual Studio -> Create New Project -> Search for SpecFlow Project

![]

Set the framework to .net core 3.1 and the test framework to Nunit

![]

Delete the initial files the come with project:
- Caculator.feature 
- CalculatorStepDefinition.cs 

In the Features folder -> Add New Item - > Specflow Feature File and name it Login.Feature

![]

Copy and Paste the following code
```Gherkin
Feature: Login

@smoke
Scenario: Login to app
	Given I launch the website
	And I enter the my username and password
		| UserName | Password |
		| raymond-msanz-test | redacted |
	When I click on the login button
	Then the I should see my username

```
#### Feature Files
Feature files are the steps our theoretical user would be doing if they had to interact with our application. In our case we have called it login which indicates we want to test the systemâ€™s behaviour when we try to login
Extra: The language this is written in is called Gherkin. There are some neat things you can do with this file to make more complex test. For now, I will show something simple.

##### Keywords
Feature
- Keyword is to provide a high-level description of a software feature, and to group related scenarios.

Scencario 
- key word give the specification of steps we want to use in our test

Steps:
- Given is to descrive the initial conditions 
- When descrive and event or action taken
- Then our expected outcome
- And can be used to chain any of the above

Before we can start writing code we need to install some nuget packages.

- Selenium.WebDriver
- Selenium.WebDriver.ChromeDriver
- Specflow
- Specflow.Nunit
- Specflow.Tools.Msbuild.Generations
- SpecFlow.Assist.Dynamic

Right click on the feature file in the code editor and select generate step definition. 

![]

Click generate and save to the steps folder as LoginSteps.cs

![]

At this point the feature file should pick up the steps from LoginStep.cs but do not worry if they do not get picked up sometimes Visual Studio takes time to make the connect. As soon as you run tests it should pick them up.

Add a new folder called Pages to the project and create a new class called FrontPage.cs. This class is where we will be writing our code to interact with the login page. 

Add the following code.
```C#
    public class FrontPage
    {
        public IWebDriver WebDriver { get; }
        public FrontPage(IWebDriver webDriver)
        {
            WebDriver = webDriver;
        }
        public IWebElement txtUsername => WebDriver.FindElement(By.Name("user"));
        public IWebElement txtPassword => WebDriver.FindElement(By.Name("passwd"));
        public IWebElement btnLogin => WebDriver.FindElement(By.XPath("//*[@id=\"login_login-main\"]/div[4]/button"));
        public IWebElement lnkPreference => WebDriver.FindElement(By.XPath("//*[@id=\"header-bottom-right\"]/ul/li/a"));

        public void ClickLoginButton() => btnLogin.Submit();
        public void Login(string username, string password)
        {
            txtUsername.SendKeys(username);
            txtPassword.SendKeys(password);
        }
        public bool IsXpathExists() => lnkPreference.Displayed;
    }
```
<details><summary>Explaination for the code snippet</summary>

```C#
public IWebDriver WebDriver { get; }
public FrontPage(IWebDriver webDriver)
{
    WebDriver = webDriver;
}
```
First we have a constructor where we pass our web driver into. We are passing the web driver as a dependency so that we can act on it using the functions we write here.

```C#
public IWebElement txtUsername => WebDriver.FindElement(By.Name("user"));
public IWebElement txtPassword => WebDriver.FindElement(By.Name("passwd"));
public IWebElement btnLogin => WebDriver.FindElement(By.XPath("//*[@id=\"login_login-main\"]/div[4]/button"));
public IWebElement lnkPreference => WebDriver.FindElement(By.XPath("//*[@id=\"header-bottom-right\"]/ul/li/a"));
```
These pieces of code are looking at the website's elements and trying to find them by Name and by their XPath. XPath is the relative path of where the element lies in the DOM.

You can find the Name by right clicking inspect on the element you wish to get. If no Name is provided for it you can get the XPath from right clicking and selecting Copy -> XPath

```C#
public void ClickLoginButton() => btnLogin.Submit();
public void Login(string username, string password)
{
    txtUsername.SendKeys(username);
    txtPassword.SendKeys(password);
}
public bool IsXpathExists() => lnkPreference.Displayed;
```
These first 2 methods are used to interact with the site and the laste is checking if the XPath for the element exist. This was found by logging in manually and inspecting a unique element only found when a user has logged in.
</details>

```C#
FrontPage frontPage = null;

[Given(@"I launch the website")]
public void GivenILaunchTheWebsite()
{
    IWebDriver webDriver = new ChromeDriver();
    webDriver.Navigate().GoToUrl("https://en.reddit.com/");
    frontPage = new FrontPage(webDriver);
}

[Given(@"I enter the my username and password")]
public void GivenIEnterTheMyUsernameAndPassword(Table table)
{
    dynamic data = table.CreateDynamicInstance();
    frontPage.Login((string)data.UserName, (string)data.Password);
}

[When(@"I click on the login button")]
public void GivenIClickOnTheLoginButton()
{
    frontPage.ClickLoginButton();
}

[Then(@"the I should see my username")]
public void ThenTheIShouldSeeMyUsername()
{
    Assert.That(frontPage.IsXpathExists, Is.True);
}

```

In our given statement we set up the web driver/chrome window and set it to the site we want
We pass this onto the frontPage object so that we can use the selenium function we wrote in the previous steps
We pass the data from our feature file which was formatted as a table. We use CreateDynamic to format this is something we can parse.
Then we act on the the login feature using CLickLocginButton
And then we check that the resulting output is true.

As you can see we still have the arrange act assert format found in our previous section. This will be true for almost all types of testing.
Right click the solution in and click run test.
This will build and run the test. It will open chrome and automatically execute the steps we laid above.
